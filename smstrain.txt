<text>Erm... since when you gave me things? hehe. Your book I will return... 4 months later.. Hee</text>
<text>Sorry I was busy and i didn&apos;t have my phone with me... Sat 6pm at marina mrt right? </text>
<text>Oh i see... It is a required module for my friend in engine.. So he&apos;s sourcing for its text... </text>
<text>I confirm going to claim your book. Hehe. And dinner as well. But I&apos;m still scared there&apos;s no tickets for Lord of the Rings. Pub? I rather go back to my bathtub. </text>
<text>Hmm... CS1105 was light when I took it but there were 3 assignments to complete. It is the lightest computing module I took though. </text>
<text>The assignments were in groups though. Else you can also check out modules with code IT1XXX. Never took them before though. </text>
<text>Hey never see you online these 2 days... Got activated or what? Chosen your modules yet? </text>
<text>I chose tuesday and friday slots. What time are you free today? I may be going to Tampines, then on the way can go and collect the book from you. </text>
<text>Yup. My stream requires it. There is exam of 100MCQs. Not confirm A lah, so long never touch biology already. Hmm.. can I get the book from you earlier? Meet at Aljunied mrt or somewhere convenient..?</text>
<text>Hmm.. I don&apos;t think I am taking anything out of my core this sem. But got 2 required cross facs which are statistics and genes and society. </text>
